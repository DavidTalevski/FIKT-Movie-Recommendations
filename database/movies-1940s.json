Before it can be taken to market, Pancho's entire crop is burned by an arsonist, and a plantation worker dies in the fire. The railroad tracks are destroyed and the workers call for a strike. Someone deliberately introduces an imported strain of banana fungus on all the plantations. Pancho is certain Kansas is involved. As things go from bad to worse, it is revealed that the chain of events were engineered by Walker, and that Kansas is a special undercover agent sent to investigate."

Dodie Smith began writing the film, and Frank Partos was brought in by his friend, associate producer Charles Brackett. Brackett wanted to have the film directed by Alfred Hitchcock but could not organize plans with him, so Allen directed it. Filming began on April 16, 1943; Allen found working with Gail Russell, who was inexperienced and began crying several times, to be the most difficult part of filming.",

At home, his attempts to bring any of his fantasies to life swiftly devolve into farce—underscored with humorous adaptations of the relevant music. In the end, the truth comes out, and love triumphs.
