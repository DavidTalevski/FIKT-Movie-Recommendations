Adapted by Miller from his own short story of the same name published in Esquire in October 1957, The Misfits was the last completed film for both Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. For Gable, the film was posthumously released, while Monroe died in August 1962 after its release. The plot centers on Roslyn Tabor (Monroe), a newly divorced woman from Reno, and her relationships with friendly landlady Isabelle Steers, an old-school cowboy Gaylord Langland (Gable), his tow truck-driving and plane-flying best friend (Wallach), and their rodeo-riding, bronc-busting friend (Clift).",

Chamberlain recounts the apocryphal Civil War stories of \"Company Q\", a unit composed of coward soldiers who are given a second chance to prove their bravery. The film had the novel title in pre-production and when released in the United Kingdom. However, the novel had none of the comedic elements of the film which retained only the basic idea of a unit formed out of men who had been court-martialed for cowardice and sent out west as well as some character names.\nThe story may have been the inspiration for the later ABC-TV sitcom F-Troop (1965-1967).",

The film's opening features the cast in puppet and live form plus caricatures of the cast by Al Hirschfeld. Among the cast were the American actors Paul O'Keefe, Jack Gilford, Ray Bolger and Margaret Hamilton, and the Australian actor Cyril Ritchard as the voice of the Sandman. Three of the voice actors: Burl Ives, and Canadian actors Billie Mae Richards and Larry D. Mann, were the voice suppliers for Videocraft's stop motion Christmas television special, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964). Some of the character voices were recorded at RCA Studios in Toronto, Ontario, under Bernard Cowan's supervision. The \"Animagic\" puppet sequences were staged by Don Duga at Videocraft in New York, and supervised by Tadahito Mochinaga at MOM Production in Tokyo, Japan.",

Forced out of retirement to investigate the deaths and disappearances of international spies, he soon battles the mysterious Dr. Noah and SMERSH. The film's tagline: \"Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond!\" refers to Bond's ruse to mislead SMERSH in which six other agents are pretending to be \"James Bond\", namely, baccarat master Evelyn Tremble ; millionaire spy Vesper Lynd ; Bond's secretary Miss Moneypenny ; Bond's daughter with Mata Hari, Mata Bond ; and British agents Coop and The Detainer.",
